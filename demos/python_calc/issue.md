# Add Multiplication and Division Functionality

Enhance the calculator app by adding two new functions:

multiply(x, y): Should return the product of x and y.
divide(x, y): Should return the result of x divided by y. Handle division by zero appropriately (e.g., return an error message or raise an exception).
Also, add corresponding unit tests for both multiply and divide in tests/test_calculator.py, covering various cases (positive, negative, zero, division by zero). Ensure all tests pass, including the existing ones.
