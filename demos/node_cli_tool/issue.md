# Implement word count CLI

In `repo/index.js`, implement a Node CLI that reads a file path from argv and prints the number of words to stdout.

Usage: `node index.js path/to/file.txt` should print just the number (e.g., `42`).

Add a small test script in `package.json` that runs `node index.js sample.txt` and checks output.
